## 📂 Overview

This project is a backend-focused version of the [Villain Trading Cards Template](https://github.com/jesteffes/villain-trading-cards-template) project. Instead of rendering Jinja templates, this version uses a RESTful API to interact with a SQLite database.

## 🦹‍♂️ Project Background

This project was part of Skillcrush's "Using Python to Build Web Apps" lesson. Using the guidance and materials provided, I built a RESTful API that manages a collection of supervillain trading cards. Users can add, view, and delete villains via HTTP requests, and all data is stored in a SQLite database using Flask-SQLAlchemy. The app is built with Flask and focuses on backend functionality, using routes and HTTP methods (GET and POST) to send and receive JSON data.
